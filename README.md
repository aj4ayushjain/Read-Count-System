# Read-Count-System
## Assignment for Pratillipi Hiring


You are having a set of stories in your system. Each story has a title and content
Needs to build a system with following functionalities :
1. Signup with a username and password
2. Log in with User Id and password
3. A page for viewing all the stories titles, and clicking them should take to the story
page
4. The story page should contain the following details :
a) Story title
b) Story content
c) Number of people currently viewing this story
d) Total read count for the story
Points to consider :
1. A single user reading a story multiple times, will be considered as a single read
2. The UI can be pretty basic, and you donâ€™t need to spend effort on much of UX either.
The backend services is where the evaluation will mostly be done on

I will be happy to listen or answer any queries.

# Tech Stack

1. Python Flask
2. Sqllite
3. Bulma+Jinja2
4. Javascript(For tracking browser close event)

Design Considerations or modifications if we think on deploying at Scale

+ Sqllite3 database is not resilient at high scale so we could shift to something resilient,
  scalable database
 
+ Use of flask-socketio for further extension on the chats belonging to story which currently 
  i didn't implement because in this it kindda be wastage of resources for just tracking the live
  viewer count
  
# Future Advancements 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Design / UI
   - The design of the system for story titles(dashboard.html) and storypage(storpage.html)
      should be redesigned
  2. Extension across Browsers-(Event of Browser Closing)
   -  So if a user abruptly closes the browser or tab while reading the story 
      the event isn't properly captured in some browsers(Chrome) so current
      viewer are not updated
  
  
# Setting up the project locally
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
1. After clone create a virtualenv in Read-Count-System dir
2. Activate the virtualenv
3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Python shell and run following commands
    - from project import create_app
    - db.create_all(app=create_app())
5. FLASK_APP=project FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```

# Deploy the project 

We need to create `wsgi.py` inside the Read-Count-System/ dir
as we are using `Application factory pattern` in flask app 
for managing the project modularly.


wsgi.py
```
from project import create_app

app = create_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

```
